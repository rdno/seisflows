For running SeisFlows on Chinook through Singularity. This class is a
kludge to get research going as Chinook is scheduled for OS upgrade in the
coming month(s) which will cause this entire kludge to become obsolete. This
code is therefore unpolished and only meant to get things working in a
band-aid/barebones manner.
